# Soda Vending Machine SPL

The feature model of the Soda Vending Machine SPL is given below. There are 4 features and 12 product configurations.  The vending machine, in its simplest form, accepts a coin, provides change, serves beverages, and eventually unlocks a compartment for the customer to retrieve their soda, after which it closes the compartment once more.

# e-Mail SPL

The feature model of the e-Mail SPL is given below. There are 5 features.  e-Mail SPL is a product line of email clients that offers the feature _addressbook_ for creating an addressbook of email contacts, _autoresponder_ for autoresponding incoming emails between a specified date interval, _forward_ for forwarding incoming emails, _encrypt_ for encrypting outgoing emails and, _sign_ or signing outgoing emails. A basic e-Mail client provides events for composing a new email and for reading an incoming email.
